Options Menu:
	-Should change based on what is currently selected.
	-Should be designed as an integral part of the feedback loop, since changing options is very common for this tool.
	Example:
		-When a program is selected, the 'options' region changes to options for the program. Options might include: 
		-Giving the program an alias (instead of process name)
		-Setting a fixed program color (TODO: all colors should be as spaced out as possible for visibility)
		-Make invisible in graph? (how would you select it again?)

Further diagram options:
	Main diagram (larger unit, default graph is called Mosaic or Mekko Charts):
		-'Stock' chart
	Side diagram (smaller unit):
		-Stacked vertical bars
		
Future design ideas:
	-Idle time can optionally be 'reclaimed' to program time _after_ the fact (i.e. while visualizing). For each program, a minimum idle time can be specified, thus counting idle time towards the previously occuring program if it is shorter than that program's minimum idle time. Example: while programming, a higher idle time is allowed, since sometimes you need to think for long. So if the user is idle for two minutes after programming, that time could be counted towards programming.
		
Very, very far away possible design ideas in the future:
	-Groups/'projects' of programs, so you can see only a few select programs in the main graph (and can select between different graph types, e.g. stock chart vs stacked default). That way you could have a group that encompasses all programming time, all (un)productive time, etc.
	-Variable time ranges (i.e. not fixed to months, days, etc. but instead from any date to any other date)?
