Options Menu:
	-Should change based on what is currently selected.
	-Should be designed as an integral part of the feedback loop, since changing options is very common for this tool.
	Example:
		-When a program is selected, the 'options' region changes to options for the program. Options might include: 
		-Giving the program an alias (instead of process name)
		-Setting a fixed program color (TODO: all colors should be as spaced out as possible for visibility)
		-Make invisible in graph? (how would you select it again?)

Further diagram options:
	Main diagram (larger unit, default graph is called Mosaic or Mekko Charts):
		-'Stock' chart
	Side diagram (smaller unit):
		-Stacked vertical bars
		
Very, very far away possible design choices in the future:
	-Groups of programs, so you can see only a few select programs in the main graph (and can select between different graph types, e.g. stock chart vs stacked default)
	-Variable time ranges (i.e. not fixed to months, days, etc. but instead from any date to any other date)?
